# EyeDiseaseClassification
#### This project helps to identify the type of eye disease that the patient suffers from, given his retinal image as input to the CNN model.  
1. The dataset on which this model is developed can be accessed from this link: [EyeDiseaseDataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunavenkatdoddi/eye-diseases-classification)  
2. The dataset description is as follows:  
  - _The dataset consists of Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract and Glaucoma retinal images where each class have approximately 1000 images. These images are collected from various sources like IDRiD, Oculur recognition, HRF etc._  
3. The code for the training and performance test can be accessed with this link: [Code](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gunavenkatdoddi/final-model-build2)  
4. Transfer Learning methodology along with tuning the parameters of SGD, and ADAM optimizers are applied to achieve benchmark performance.
